Hello my name is <%= params.name %>.  I'm <%= params.age %> years old.  I quit my job for
a job at a startup, and I think I made a mistake.  Not for quitting, but just not
the right place.  I think everyone here is crazy!  I just don't know what happened.

<% for( var i = 1; i <= params.name.length; i++ ) { -%>
   <%= params.name.substring( 0, i ) %>
<% } -%>

Can this get any better?

<%= params.name %>
